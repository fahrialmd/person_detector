The Person Detector is an IoT Project that detects whether there are people passing within its HCSR-04 range and count the number of people passing by. The device uses the Firebase Realtime Database to read data from the sensor, listening to changes and then storing the results. As well as detecting presence, the device can also be used in security applications by sending an alert through flutter app when someone enters/exits a specific zone. The device is powered by two Li-Ion batteries with voltage regulator for running at 5 V.
