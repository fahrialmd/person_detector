# IOT Project: Person Detector V1

## Project Description

The Person Detector is an IoT Project that detects whether there are people passing within its HCSR-04 range and count the number of people passing by. The device uses the Firebase Realtime Database to read data from the sensor, listening to changes and then storing the results. As well as detecting presence, the device can also be used in security applications by sending an alert through flutter app when someone enters/exits a specific zone. The device is powered by two Li-Ion batteries with voltage regulator for running at 5 V.

## Project Goals

1. To learn how to program ESP32 so it can read sensor data and connect to WPA2 Enterprise WIFI.
2. To learn how to integrate an electronic device with internet via Firebase.
3. To learn how to fetch the data store in firebase into mobile apps with flutter.
4. To learn how to design and create 3D structures with Fusion360 and a 3D printers.
